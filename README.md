# Clean Code

## Chapter 1: Clean Code
If developers write poor code, the productiviy decreases when time passes. The project become more and more messy, and there will be a day that the project just cannot continue.

The clean code is elegant, efficiency, simple, direct and readable.
The clean code means no duplication, one thing, expressivess, tiny abstraction.

"Clean code can be read, and enhanced by a developer other than its original author. It has unit and acceptance tests. It has meaningful
names. It provides one way rather than many ways for doing one thing. It has minimal dependencies, which are explicitly defined, and provides a clear and minimal API. Code should be literate since depending on the language, not all necessary information can be expressed clearly in code alone."

## Chapter 2: Meaingful Names
* The name should tell why it exists, what it does, and how it is used.
* The name should not be obscure and give the reader false clues on the variable or function. For exampleï¼šIf the name of a variable contains list, then the data structure of the variable should be list.
* Do not use the names that are meaningless (noise), for example a, b, c. 
* Do not use single-letter name in a large scope, since it will not be easy to locate/search. The length of a name should correspond to the size of its scope.  
* Class name should be noun/noun phrase, method name should be verb/verb phrase.
* One world per concept.
