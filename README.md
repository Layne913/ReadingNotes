# Clean Code

# Chapter 1: Clean Code
If developers write poor code, the productiviy decreases when time passes. The project become more and more messy, and there will be a day that the project just cannot continue.

The clean code is elegant, efficiency, simple, direct and readable. 

Clean code can be read, and enhanced by a developer other than its original author. It has unit and acceptance tests. It has meaningful
names. It provides one way rather than many ways for doing one thing. It has minimal dependencies, which are explicitly defined, and provides a clear and minimal API. Code should be literate since depending on the language, not all necessary information can be expressed clearly in code alone.
